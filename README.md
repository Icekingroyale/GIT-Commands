# GIT-Commands
The repo contains some of my favourite commands for working with git.

1.  `git init` is used to initalize a git repository

```sh
git init
```


2. `git status` is used to check the status of your files in the repository
```sh
git status
```

```


5. `git log` shows a log of all the commits available
